### About me

I have a background in industrial engineering and data analysis working for Sanofi and Unipharm companies helping them to improve the adoption rate and delivery time of new reports while increasing the quality of the information.

After +8 years, I decided that software development was the best path due to my preference to create tools and optimize time to solve problems. I then decided to join Microverse, a remote online school where I have spent +1300 hours learning to code. Since joining, I have developed more than 40 projects, learned skills like pair programming, git-flow, build projects based on requirements, do extensive research to accomplish goals, and meet deadlines.
